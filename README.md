# March 2023 - February 2024 Manhattan Property Sales

Understanding the makeup of a borough's property sales can be important when deciding which neighborhoods to invest into and which ones to avoid. Additionally, determining what property type does well in those neighborhoods can make all of the difference.

I reviewed Manhattan's property sales over a 12-month period (March 2023 to Febrauary 2024) in various formats (Google Colab with Python, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau). I found that initial dataset on New York City's Department of Finance website (https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/property/property-rolling-sales-data.page).

I have posted various Excel files, including the original from their website and altered versions from my own data cleaning directly in the file and through Python in Google Colab.
